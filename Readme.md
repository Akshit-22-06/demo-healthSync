🩺 HealthSync

Web-Based Personal Health & Wellness Management System
Built with Python & Django

⸻

📌 Project Overview

HealthSync is a role-based web application designed to help users monitor personal health metrics, access medically reviewed articles, participate in a health community, and receive doctor specialization suggestions through a rule-based symptom checker.

This is an academic project built using Django following proper software engineering practices (SRS, UML, RBAC, modular design).

⸻

🎯 Core Objectives
	•	Allow users to track daily health metrics.
	•	Provide medically reviewed health articles.
	•	Enable moderated community discussions.
	•	Suggest doctor specializations based on symptoms.
	•	Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
	•	Maintain structured and scalable Django architecture.

⸻

👥 User Roles (RBAC)

The system contains 3 actors:

1️⃣ User
	•	Register / Login
	•	Update profile
	•	Track health logs
	•	View health score
	•	Read articles
	•	Post articles (draft)
	•	Participate in community discussions
	•	Use symptom checker

2️⃣ Doctor
	•	Review submitted articles
	•	Approve or reject articles
	•	Provide medical validation

3️⃣ Admin
	•	Full system access
	•	Manage users & doctors
	•	Assign roles
	•	Moderate community posts
	•	Publish approved articles
	•	Control article visibility

⸻

🏗 System Architecture

HealthSync follows Django’s MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.

Main Components:
	•	Authentication & Role Management
	•	Health Tracking Module
	•	Article Management Module
	•	Community Discussion Module
	•	Symptom Checker Module
	•	Admin Moderation Panel

🧠 Symptom Checker Design

⚠️ Important:
This is a static rule-based system, NOT AI-based medical diagnosis.


User selects symptoms
        ↓
System maps symptoms → Specialization
        ↓
Specialization maps → Available Doctors
        ↓
System suggests doctor specialization
Data Mapping:
	•	Symptom → Specialization
	•	Specialization → Doctor

No medical diagnosis is provided.

📊 Health Score Calculation

Health score is calculated based on:
	•	Sleep duration
	•	Water intake
	•	Exercise time
	•	Mood rating
	•	Meal consistency
	•	Weight tracking consistency

Formula is rule-based and can be improved later.

⸻

🔐 Security & Access Control
	•	Django Authentication System
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	•	Admin-only management routes
	•	Doctor-only review routes
	•	User-specific health logs (data isolation)

📌 Important Notes for AI Assistants (Codex)

When generating or modifying code:
	1.	Maintain role-based access control.
	2.	Do NOT convert symptom checker into medical diagnosis AI.
	3.	Follow Django best practices.
	4.	Keep models normalized.
	5.	Maintain separation of concerns.
	6.	Avoid breaking existing authentication logic.
	7.	Preserve article status workflow.
	8.	Ensure data validation on forms.
